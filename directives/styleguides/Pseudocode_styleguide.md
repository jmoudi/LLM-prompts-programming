# Pseudocode

## Colorization
Colorize the pseudocode, like you would regular code.
The colors are such: prefer TypeScript-like, then Java-like, then Python-like, then Fortran-like, then an arbitrary fallback color scheme.
E.g. if your pseudocode uses `FUNCTION`, colorize it like TS colors `function`. 


LLMs (like you) are able to read imperfect or incomplete prompts. For example, if I wrote "I liv in a gree hous", the LLM would expand it to "I live in a green house".
